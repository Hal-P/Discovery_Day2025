This document is the r-code I will be using to clean and merge the data I need for Discovery Day 2025!

*Loading in the Data*
```{r include=FALSE}
# The "here" library will let me read the data from an individual folder.
library(here)

# I read the data and put it in a dataframe Object.

baseline <- read.csv(here("Data", "Baselinesurvey.CSV"), header = FALSE, sep = ",") # Read the file

daily <- read.csv(here("Data", "DailySummaries_2025.CSV"), header = FALSE, sep = ",") # Read the file

Bed <- read.csv(here("Data", "DailyTimeInBed_2025.CSV"), header = FALSE, sep = ",") # Read the file
```
